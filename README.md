# Aula_VR_2.0

Professional training environment in virtual reality with 360 videos.

It allows you to live real job interviews, make your own decisions and get a report for a self-job-coach.

This is a VR app build in Unity. It has been tested and works properly in a Samsung Galaxy S5 device with Android.

** There are no video files in this Git project. (Will be soon available!)
